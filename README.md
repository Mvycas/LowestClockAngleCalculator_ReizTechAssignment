# Lowest Clock Angle Calculator ReizTech Assignment
This assignment was done using locked hour and minute hands (real-life simulation). Meaning that when the time is 12:50, the hour hand will not be exactly at 12, because it has already moved by ~25 degrees. Therefore input of 12:15 will not give us 90 degree angle.

**Main code is in "LowestClockAngleCalculator_ReizTechAssignment/BlazorApp1/Pages/ClockAngleCalc.razor"**

This assignment was done in c# using blazor pages. I did implemented a very simple UI.
